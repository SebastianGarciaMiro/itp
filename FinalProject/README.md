# Final Project
### By Sebastian Garcia Miro

Another semester passed where I look back and I see everything I wanted to achieve, and feel good that I did it. Coding was one of those things. I was almost always interested in this because my brother does a lot of it and he always seemed to have so much fun with it (and sometimes he would hack my videogames so that I could be better at them haha). Well, now that 15 weeks have gone by, it's time to say bye to my third year of college, now I only have one more to go and I can finally be free! (just joking)

Well, getting back into ky project itself. I remember that my proposal was to do a "Rotten Tomatoes" but for music gear instead of just movies. I wanted to do a place where people could rate their gear so that anyone that wants to buy it could see the pros and cons of it, because Reddit is sometimes not the best at it. Good thing that I was told off because if I already struggled enough in this "simple" project, I can't imagine what my life would have been if I actually went for the orginal idea.

First, I have to say that the only class that I missed, was the class where everyone learnt how to program using HTML, so I was in some disadvantage to learn. Before I went to class 2 weeks ago, when we did the Band website group project, I started doing a lot of reaserch on my own, and I do have to admit that ChatGPT basically taught me how to use HTML. So when I started the final project, I first went through what I learnt in the Band group project and what ChatGPT taught me.

I created the index.html and added the code
 `<header>`
   `<h1 class="logo">`Sebastian Garcia Miro`</h1>`
    `<img src="images/profile.jpg"` alt="Sebastian Garcia Miro" class="profile-pic">
  `</header>`
  to create a header with my name with it. I used the same science in all of the headers from every section but I didn't but an image in all of them. Also, the headers after the main one are `h2`so that they won't be as big and present as the main title of my website.

I aslo created the style.css file so that I could edit the style of my website and make it look cooler. For the band project, we did a black background with white letters, and I really like how it looked so I copied the idea into my own website. I also used the style.css to align all of my headers and paragraphs in the middle, because it was looking a little weird when it was all align to the left.

The biggest problem I faced was finding out what part of my code was wrong. For some reason, everything I saw was looking good but my website was not working. It would sometimes load without any style, or it would sometimes just be in blank too. I tried from many divices, and some of them would have different outcomes, so I had no other choice than to contact the coding master himself. You might think that this "coding master" is ChatGPT, but no, the coding master is my older brother. He read my whole script and after some minutes he turned to me and said "I have no idea what's going on". Not even the coding master could help me. I was starting to get stressed so I left my code there because when I get stressed I mess things up. The next morning I tried doing it again and because I read all of it calmy while drinking the biggest cup of coffee that Starbucks had to offer I noticed that I was missing a dot. I had written the code:
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="stylecss">` instead of  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`.

Like magic, everything was resolved. All of my stress suddenly became relief because I solved the problem that not even my brother could. I know it was just adding a simple dot, but when you have a big code, sometimes it's hard to miss. Or at least for me that I'm a begginer in this type of things.

When everything was working like it should, I added the images on a folder in my repo. I don't know if theres a faster way to do it, but that was the way we did it in the band project, so it was the only familiar way I knew how to do it. There was code in my index.html that would mention for example `guitar.jpg` so I named the guitar picture as that because I was tired of messing things up by spelling mistakes.

Every time I updated my website, it would take a long time to show when I opened the link. I don't know why this happens but it was annoying to me. I couldn't see if the images were working or if I had done something wrong, so I once again called my brother desperately. He was in a work meeting so he couldn't read my whole code, but he told me a shortcut. I could check each individual image by entering my website/images/whateverimageIwastryingtosearch. So for example, to check the guitar image, I entered the link: [sebastiangarciamiro.github.io/images/guitar.jpg](https://sebastiangarciamiro.github.io/images/guitar.jpg) and if I could see the image there, then it was working fine.

After that, my website was working perfectly fine, as it should. I will also mention that I added some links and paragraphs to make it look better, but it was nothing very fancy. If I had had more time, I would've made it look cooler, I have some good ideas to work on it in the future, but at least I'm satisfied with what I got. Now, after uploading this markdown, I will start doing the slides for the presentation. I hope I don't have problems while doing it since I won't be able to document it hahaha.

Anyways, thanks for this awesome semester! I learnt so much from this class and I'm excited to use the knowledge I gained in my own career opportunities. Have a wonderful summer and thank you for being so kind.
