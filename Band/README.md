# Finding Emo
### By Sebastian (me) Zoe, Annie Z and Julian

## Group Project
Well first of all,  I have to thank the professor for assigning this group project with random classmates, because I got to meet some very cool people that I didn't had the chance to talk to yet. We all had different backgrounds with coding that naturally led us into different roles to make everything work very efficiently and consice.

I'm going to make a quick note saying that I've never seen a band name picked so quickly. I swear that not even 3 seconds had passed since the professor grouped us together until Zoe screamed to us the name. We all agreed instantly while laughing.

## The Website
The website is obviously very simple, but I think that we are all very proud of the result. The website became more and more complex every time until we got the final result. This final result consists of 2 sections.

The first is called "Home" and it cosists of the:

1. Title.
2. Band logo.
3. Hiperlink to our newest single (and a teaser next to it).
4. Band description.

The second section is called "Bios", which consists of:

1. Band photo.
2. Band members bios.

We tried making it as emo and funny as possible, like for example the Rick Roll, which was Julian's idea. There are a lot of jokes in this website, we all had a blast doing it. 

I would say that the biggest problem that we faced was some lack of communication, since the start we forgot to introduce ourselves and then later it felt a little hard some times to grab everyone's attention to ask questions or give suggestions. Apart from the communication issues, I think that we did a good job in everything else, considering that not all of us were that confident in coding and also the fact that none of us knew eachother from before. This communication problem was solved by stopping everything we were doing and introducing ourselves again (we laughed a lot because no one realized that we didn't introduce ourselves).

## Self Assessment
Regarding myself in this group project. I started it very scared because I missed last week's class due to an emergency, and even though I read the whole file from last class, I was still having trouble to understand everything. Thankfully, my teammate Zoe was very comfortable with HTML and she didn't hesitate to explain to us about the things and shortcuts she knew.

I still helped with everything I could. I do have to say that I used some help from ChatGPT to generate the band logo and to organize my ideas regarding the band's story and some of our band mates backgrounds as well. I didn't feel the need to link the conversation into this documentation file because nothing (besides the band logo) was really ai generated. It was just organization of ideas to have some better clarity with wording and phrasing.

I aslo came up with ideas for the website, the bandmates, the band's backstory and maybe a couple of things more that I'm forgetting to say here.

## Group Assessments
Zoe: If anyone from my group says that Zoe wasn't leading this whole project, then that person is lying. She was very sweet and nice and did her best to make the website look awesome as well as helping us understand what was she doing so that we could learn from her as well. I wouldn't say she "carried" the project only because the rest of the team were more focused in the creative side of things. Also, as I am writing this documentation file, just because she is bored, she is updating our website even more and I think that's super nice of her. If I don't mention something from the website is very likely that she will add it after I submit this markdown file.

Julian: Overall, great and funny guy. He came up with some very fun ideas like the Rick Roll joke when you click on the  band's newest single. He also helped Zoe a lot with ideas for the website's layout and colors. Apart from that I would say that him and I were doing similar things to complement the website.

Annie Z: Our first idea as a group was to make a general documentation file, and then just edit it with our own experiences. That idea was going for the first hour of the class, until it was shut down by the professor. After that, the website was mostly finished so from what I saw, she was just helping Zoe with more ideas for the layout of the website. She also did her own story for her band character.

Overall: Zoe was focused on the coding, Annie Z was first focused in the markdown file and later helped Zoe with layout and ideas for the website, Julian was a bit hybrid in between helping Zoe and giving cool ideas for the band website, and I was just focused on the creative side of things.
