###"In the Moonlight" By Josa Buson

The first thing that I did for this homework was the reaserch for the haiku poem that resonated with me. Then after a couple of tries I found a website called [reedsy.com](https://reedsy.com/discovery/blog/haiku-poem-examples) where I found this haiku poem called "In the Moonlight" written by Josa Buson that made me feel somehow related to.

The haiku poem is: "In pale moonlight, the wisteriaâ€™s scent, comes from far away".

The interesting thing is that I really don't understand why. I do not know what the word wisteria means, but for some reason I really resonated to this poem. I have a feeling it might be the phonetics but still, it was the haiku I liked the most.

After that I proceded with the "coding" part of the homework. I first opened Terminal and typed the code `pwd`to know where was I. As expected I was in Users/(my user) so I later used the code `ls` to see the available folders I had there. I later used the code `cd documents`to enter that folder and continued the process of those 3 commands until I reached the folder "haiku" (which was inside of the "itp" folder and that was inside the "Github" folder and that folder was inside of the "Documents" folder).

Once I reached the "Haiku" folder I used the following code:

`say "In pale moonlight, the wisteria's scent, comes from far away" -o haiku.aiff 
`

I based this code from the one we did in class which was:

`say "Hello,world" -o hello.aiff`

However, I changed the "Hello, world" to the haiku poem which I copy pasted from the website mentioned above. 

Thankfully, I did not encounter any problems with anything for this assignment, but I do admit that I would love to know how to change the computer's voice because personally, I do not like that one.
