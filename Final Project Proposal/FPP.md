# Final Project
### By Sebastian Garcia Miro

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Amplify(.com)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

Before I buy music gear, I always wanted a place were I could see some ratings abot that gear that people who own the gear wrote, besides reddit and youtube, which often times not show what you want to see and they don't give a clear rating on products. I plan to solve this issue I have with creating a website were musicians can rate gear they own or have owned before, so that future customers can now if they actually need it or not.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

Reverb(.com), JavaScript, Chatgpt

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My website (at least in planning stages) will have every type of both digital and analog music gear, and will allow you to create an account and give a rating from 1 to 100, as well as a comment on why did they made that decision. This way, people who want the gear can see if it matches their expectations or if it's not as good as advertised, according to other musicians who have already used those products.

I intend this to be like a Rotten Tomatoes for movies, or IMDB for shows, where people give their rating so that there could be a an overall rating of a product. This might be too ambitious for me to do it alone. However, if I see support from the classroom or my project ends up being better than I thought with my litte programming knowledge, I will contiue it once this class is over, so that maybe one day it could be released to the public. 

## Will any work as part of this project overlap with any work you are doing outside of this class? For another class? Who is the professor in this class?

Not really, I am doing this project for both academic and persona reasons, but nothing to do with another class.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A basic, let me repeat it so that I know I'm being clear, a BASIC `BASIC` version of the website. Because it is a very ambitious idea with too many gear to be included, like consoles, guitar pedals, synths, plug ins, etc; I plan to at least do a couple of categories and show both the professor and the classroom what this website would consist of in a future.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I receive some help, being from friends, family, teachers, or whoever is interested in helping, then maybe I could add some cool visual aid and more categories, as well as having at least the home page of the website "finished" to show the class the different categories I intend to put for different gear.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Imagining the case that I get help and that I'm also a programming prodigy, I would hope to have some categories finished as well as the home page. My expectations are not super super high, but this is a very big project, and I already accepted the fact that it might be far from finished once I present it in class. But, at least I'l show some progress and hopefully people will like it.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I don't know how to be very specific, but considering that we have less 4 weeks left, I intend to do a lot of reaserchthis first week and ask the professor for some ideas and guidance during her office hours in Tuesday. The second week I plan to start programing the website until I have something that works and meets my expectations. During the third week, I would be adding as much content as I can to the webpage, and trying to make it look as pretty as possible. And lastly, the fourth week would be just me trouble shooting and making sure that everything is ready to present in class.
